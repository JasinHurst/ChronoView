I'm continuing my ChronoView React project.

✅ Environment:
- Node.js v22.16.0
- npm v10.9.2
- React app already created and working

💾 Project path:
~/OneDrive/Desktop/ChronoView

📁 Folder structure:
ChronoView/
 ├── ChronoView_Architecture.txt
 ├── LICENSE.txt
 ├── node_modules/
 ├── package.json
 ├── package-lock.json
 ├── public/

      ├── App.css
      ├── App.js
      ├── assets/
      ├── index.css
      └── index.js

💡 Context:
- We fixed the missing `reportWebVitals.js` issue.
- The app builds and runs successfully with `npm start`.
- I’m building the ChronoView frontend with React and custom CSS.
- I plan to add React Router and structure the site into pages and components.

Pick up from here and help me continue developing the frontend.
