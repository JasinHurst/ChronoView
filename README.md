ChronoView is my personal research project built around hermetic time-cycle analysis, astro-numerology, and pattern recognition across markets, personal timelines, and historical events. The whole idea is to map time the way I actually study it: planetary cycles, numerology, and long-term rhythms all combined into one system. I’m building this so I don’t have to rely on anyone else’s software or interpretations — just my own logic, my own models, and my own datasets. Technically, ChronoView is a full-stack setup using React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend, and I’m hosting the whole thing on AWS. The frontend handles the UI, the time-cycle visuals, the charts, and all the interaction. The backend processes the planetary data, numerology logic, time calculations, and anything related to cycle computation. Eventually I’m building a fully custom chart/horoscope engine that converts numerology into actual time-cycles, so I can visualize the repeating signatures that show up in markets and use those to analyze stocks, crypto, and anything with a price history. It’s basically my version of a trading-focused time-cycle tool, but grounded in astrology and numerology instead of the typical technical-analysis indicators everyone else uses. The whole purpose of ChronoView is to explore how time, numbers, and planetary movement line up with real-world outcomes — especially financial ones. It’s not meant to be a polished commercial product. It’s something I’m building for myself, for people who actually care about cycle theory, hermetic philosophy, astrology, numerology, and the underlying patterns that repeat through history. Everything in this repo exists so I can test and visualize ideas in a way that mainstream tools don’t support.
