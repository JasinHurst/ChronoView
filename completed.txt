🧠 What You’re Using
Tool / Library	Purpose	Why It’s Used
PostgreSQL	Your main database system.	Stores user accounts, session data, and other app information securely.
DBeaver	Database management tool.	Lets you visually create, edit, and query your PostgreSQL database.
pg	Node.js PostgreSQL client library.	Allows your backend code to connect to and interact with your PostgreSQL database.
bcrypt	Password hashing library.	Hashes and salts passwords before saving them to the database for strong security.
dotenv	Environment variable loader.	Keeps sensitive information (like DB credentials and keys) out of your code.
react / react-dom / react-router-dom	Core frontend framework.	Builds your site’s user interface and handles routing between pages.
tailwindcss / postcss / autoprefixer	Styling utilities.	Provide modern, responsive CSS design with browser compatibility.
react-scripts / testing-library	React build and testing tools.	Automate app builds and ensure your components work correctly.
🔐 Security & Architecture Summary

You’re using PostgreSQL (created and managed through DBeaver) as your backend database.

Your Node.js backend uses pg to connect to that database.

User passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt before storage — no plain text passwords.

Sensitive data like connection strings and secret keys are loaded via dotenv from a .env file.

The React frontend communicates with this backend, forming a clean full-stack architecture.
