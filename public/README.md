# 🌒 ChronoView  
### Hermetic Time-Cycle and Astro-Numerology Analysis

**ChronoView** is a research and visualization project focused on hermetic time-cycle analysis — combining astrology, numerology, and historical event data to reveal repeating planetary and numerical patterns through time.  
It provides a framework for studying correspondences between celestial cycles, number harmonics, and collective or personal timelines.

## 🔮 Features
- Planetary transit and cycle tracking  
- Numerological time-cycle correlation (personal and historical)  
- Custom visualization of repeating patterns and phase alignments  
- Esoteric time-mapping for hermetic and astrological research  
- Modular architecture designed for expansion into real-time data visualization

---

## ⚙️ Technical Overview
ChronoView’s architecture integrates:
- **Frontend:** Interactive visualization and analysis interface  
- **Backend:** Time-cycle computation and planetary data processing  
- **Data Layer:** Ephemeris, numerological algorithms, and custom event datasets  

*(See `ChronoView_Architecture.txt` for structural details.)*

## 🜍 Purpose
ChronoView is designed for researchers, astrologers, and hermetic practitioners who explore the metaphysical relationships between **time, number, and planetary rhythm**.  
It serves as both a conceptual and analytical tool for identifying the recurring signatures that underlie temporal cycles.
